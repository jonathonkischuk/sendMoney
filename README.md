# sendMoney
Basic Solidity contract for sending and withdrawing money
It allows us to check the balance of the account before and after sending or receiving money.
It also shows the difference in two manners of checking our balance (balanceReceived and getBalance)
We also look at timestamp and use it to temporarily lock transactions for a set period after a transaction has taken place.
Using withdrawMoneyTo, we can deal with a specified account, rather than withdrawMoney or receiveMoney.
